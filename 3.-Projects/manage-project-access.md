# **Managing Project-LevelAccess**

You might not want all of your API projects accessible to everyone on your workspace, or sometimes may want them accessible for just specific individuals. Luckily you can control who gets to see your project and who does not. Read on this guide to learn how to configure that. 

## What is Project-level access?

Project-level access adds another layer of access control to your API. With this you can filter out who on your workspace can or cannot view your project. There are three different settings you can switch between:

### 1. **Public Documentation**

Set the project visibility as **Public** to allow anyone on the Internet, including anonymous users, to view the project contents.

### 2. **Internal Documentation**

Set the project visibility as **Internal** to allow *authenticated workspace members* to access the project. Projects with **Internal** visibility will not be accessible to unauthenticated users.

### 3. **Private Documentation**

Set the project visibility as **Private** to restrict access only to users with direct access. Give authenticated users access to the project documentation by adding them under the **Manage Access** tab under the project settings.

1. If your project is not public you can invite users by sending them a mail. To do that type in their email and chose their role.
