# Sidebar Customization

The Stoplight sidebar changes depending on who you are and what page you're on.

<!-- 
focus: top

## Workspace Projects List
For **anonymous users**, the sidebar on your homepage will consist of your public projects and public groups. 

For **authenticated workspace members**, the sidebar will only show you the projects and groups you've specifically joined or created.

<!-- theme: success -->
> Ready to pin your favorite Groups and Projects? Learn how to [Populate Your Sidebar](a.workspace-sidebar.md).

## Project Table of Contents

A project can have all [types of documentation](../b.types-of-documentation.md) beyond just [API References](../c.quality-api-reference-docs.md).

<!-- theme: success -->
> To customize the order and structure of your project sidebar, you'll need to create your own [Table of Contents](d.table-of-contents.md) file.
