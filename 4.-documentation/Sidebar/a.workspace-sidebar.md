# Workspace Sidebar

The sidebar is the primary navigation for all workspaces and contains the following elements:

1. **Search** - Available to all users, but will only return results for Projects the user has access to.
2. **Explore** - Available to workspace members only. The explorer makes it easier to find , search, and manage all available API artifacts.
3. **Projects** - For workspace members, all the projects that you've either joined or created will show up in your sidebar. External users (i.e., not logged in) will only see public projects. Learn to [manage Project-level access](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/platform/ZG9jOjE4ODEyMQ-sharing-documentation).
4. **Groups** - Customers on either *Professional* or *Enterprise* plans can further control their sidebars by creating groups of projects. Learn more about [Groups](2.-workspaces/m.groups.md).
