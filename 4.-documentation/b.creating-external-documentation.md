# Creating External API Documentation

With your project added to Stoplight, you are now ready to share your API documentation. But do you have all things ready?  Learn what you need to do before you can share your API documentation publicly. 

## **What makes Good Documentation?**

Now that you have put in good work in your API Design, you need to share it with developers. But before you do that, you have to ensure all your artifacts are complete. Remember the main goal of the entire exercise(design first) is to ensure your consumers get a great developer experience. 

While you would have most checks ticked while working on Design, you need to make sure you are not missing out on these: 

**ðŸ‘‰ Landing Page:** The home-screen to give an intro to your APIs. 

**ðŸ‘‰ Quick Starts:** Getting-Started guides to get consumers ready to consume APIs

**ðŸ‘‰ Guides and Tutorials:** Tutorials to explain how to work with the API. 

**ðŸ‘‰ API References**: **Endpoints**, **Models** and **Resources** with **examples and** complete description of each. 

**ðŸ‘‰ Code Snippets:** Code samples derived from your references. 

Note: To learn more about API Documentation best practices. Visit our Guide: **Quality API documentation.** 

## Sharing Documentation

Before sharing documentation with external users, you need to make sure you have everything we mentioned above. Once you have those artifacts, you can follow these steps: 

### 1. **Customizing Landing Page**

Often people miss out on customizing the landing page for their workspaces. Your landing page on stoplight is your homescreen, it the first thing users coming to your documentation will see. Use your landing page to highlight getting started guides, tutorials, how-tos, and anything that would help users navigate your documentation better. 

> **Note:** There's an example template available to get started quickly. You can edit or completely replace the default template using Stoplight Flavored Markdown from the workspace settings.

 Before advancing any further, we recommend you visit our guide for configuring the home screen. 

### 2.  Personalizing Workspace:

Just like your Landing Page, your Stoplight workspace can be personalized for a more bespoke experience. Any personalization you make to your workspace will be reflected throughout the Stoplight platform.

You can customize: 

1. **Basics:** The Name and Logo. 
2. **Theme:** The look and feel. 
3. **Sidebar**: To reorder or rearrange articles. 
4. **Custom Domain:** Your own personal hosting address. 
5. **Hide Sign Button:** Remove the sign button from workspace.

### 3. **Managing Project-Level Access**

To make your documentation accessible for all users, you will need to update access settings for your projects. You can do that by navigating to your projects and clicking share. You switch between: 

1. **Public**: Anyone on the internet. 
2. **Internal**: Anyone with workspace access. 
3. **Private**: Invite only access to specific users.

### 4. Sharing Workspace URL

With your landing page ready and projects set to the correct visibility,Â **share your workspace URL with users**Â to let them access your documentation. 

For internal or private projects,Â [invite users](../9.-teams/d.inviting-your-team.md)Â to the workspace directly.
