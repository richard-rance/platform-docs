# Directory Structure

Before you start working on your APIs, you need to know how projects are structured on Stoplight. Read this guide for a detailed walk through on how the Stoplight file tree spans out. 

## How are files organized on Stoplight?

Stoplight supports five key API Design and Documentation files in multiple formats. The general categories for these files are located within the file creation dropdown (**+**). They include:

- **API:** API Description Documents
- **Endpoint:** Individual Paths & Operations
- **Model:** Reusable API Components
- **Article:** Supplemental Markdown Files
- **Image:** Supplemental Images

Additionally you have these some more files to help organize your work and assist you with tasks: 

- **Style Guides:** For customizing the [validation and linting](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/studio/ZG9jOjc4-validation-and-linting)
- **Table of Contents:** How your files are organized
- **Stoplight config:** Project settings

When you import your API project to Stoplight either via Git, CLI or version control of your choice, Stoplight goes through your entire repository, picks up the files we want and stores them in different folders. 

- **Articles** (markdown files) files under the **Docs** sections.
- **Media** (jpg, jpeg, png, mp4) content ****under **Assets.**
- **JSON/YAML** files under APIs.

## Working with files

Working with files is very easy, to create a new file you just need to:

2. Click on the "+" button near the top of side navbar. 
3. Chose the type of file you want and start working away.

By default the file will be stored in the manner we mentioned above, if you want them in a differtn folder you can reorganize. 

## Adding a File from outside Stoplight

In case you want to add a file to your project from local storage, you do not have to make it go through version control, you can easily import to Stoplight anytime you want. To do that:

1. Navigate to and open your project. 
2. Click on the "+" button near the top of side navbar. 
3. Click **Import File** and chose a file from your storage.

4. The file will be added to the default folder. You will have to manually reorganize.

## Reorganizing Files

You can move a file to a new folder, or switch between folders within your project. To do that switch to the **Files** section on side navbar. 

**Tip:** We recommend you always sort files into their respective folders for better navigation and discovery.

To reorganize: 

1. Navigate to and open your project. 
2. Switch to Files section on side navbar. 
3. Click on the file you want to move, and drag it over the folder you want it in. 
4. You can create new folders called **directories** to sort your files.
