## Creating Security Schemes

Creating a security scheme on Stoplight is very easy. You can work on it using our UI Editor or  raw description file on our JSON editor. 

For the **UI editor,** start by following these steps:

1. Navigate to your project and open the **API Overview** for your API.

2. On the **API Overview** page, scroll down to **Security Schemes** and click the **+** (plus) icon that appears next to it.

3. Select the **scheme** type from the dropdown that opens as a result of it. 

4. Give your scheme a **name** in the key field. This key must be unique within the API and will be used to reference the scheme in a security requirement.

5. Specify additional settings depending on the scheme type, as explained in the guide: **API Security**

6. Optionally, click the **description** button  to add a human-readable description with more information about your scheme.

2. Switch to **Code** mode. 
3. Make your edits.
