# Create an API

Once you have created a new project or cloned your existing project from Github, you can either start working on your existing APIs or create a new API. We will discuss how in this guide. 

## Creating a Project

Before you can create a new API, you first need to either create a new project or clone your existing project from Github. 

**Projects** on Stoplight, are a place for you to manage APIs, articles, and any other files that you want to store together. A project can have multiple APIs. 

> **Note:** To learn more how to work with Projects visit our guide: [**Adding a Project**](url)

Once you have projects on your **workspace**, your homepage should look like this.

4. You can also import an API description file form your local storage.

Upon clicking **Create**, a new API description document will be created and added to the project. Specify the  global information about the API and get started with API design.
