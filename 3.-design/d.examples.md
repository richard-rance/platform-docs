# Examples

You can enrich your API docs and code samples with examples to help consuming developers understand your API faster. In this guide, we'll discuss how. 

## What are Examples?

Examples in your documentation are the sample values that go for each individual field, parameter, model, request, or response body. Example values in your documentation help developers under your API faster. Examples also help generate better mocks and code-samples as well so developers can try out your APIs in real-time. 

For the best documentation and code samples: 

- Try using real-life data.
- Test their correctness. Stoplights validates these for you automatically
- Give explanatory names
- Cover all your essential use cases

## Working with Examples

You can add examples for any field in your documentation. Let's say you want to add example for a single field such as query parameter to your endpoint. 

1. Navigate to your endpoint on Stoplight studio. 

2. If you want to add an example value for a field such as a query parameter, header, security field, or cookie. Click on the respective field. 

3. Specify the name and description for the field, and then click the **Other Properties** button.

4. This will open a pop up. Scroll to the bottom to enter a suitable example value. 

5. To add examples for a **body**, click on the **example** button next to Schema. This will open a raw JSON editor. Enter the values for the fields in your schema.
