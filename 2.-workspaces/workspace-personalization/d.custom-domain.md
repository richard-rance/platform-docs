# Custom Domains

If you want to have your workspace behind a domain of your choice, you can set up a custom domain with Stoplight.

## What is a Custom domain?

Your **domain** on Stoplight is the URL or web address where your workspace lives. By default, when you sign up for Stoplight, your domain address looks like this: [`your-company-name.stoplight.com`](http://your-store-name.myshopify.com/)

> **ðŸ‘‰ Note:** When you share your documentation with external users or team members, you essentially share your domain address. 

If you want to host your Stoplight workspace on a domain fully under your control, then you can add a custom URL, such as [`api.example.com`](http://www.example.com/). The new URL will be your **custom domain**. 

Stoplight currently requires the full domain to be allocated for use, meaning that it is not possible to expose documentation from a single path or route.

As an example, the domain `"api.example.com"` can be used to host your Stoplight documentation, however `"example.com/api"` (note the "/api" base path) cannot.

## **Before you get started:**

- You need a private domain address.
- You need admin privileges to your Stoplight account.

## Configuring a custom domain for your workspace

To setup a custom domain for your Stoplight workspace: 

1. From your dashboard, select **workspace settings** from the top-left drop-down. 
2. Navigate to Settings > Basics > Custom Domain. 
3. Enter the custom domain you would like to use.

To complete the configuration process, you will need to create a CNAME DNS record for your domain that points toÂ `ingress.stoplight.io`.

Once properly configured, accessing the custom domain should allow you to access the Stoplight workspace and an SSL certificate for your domain will automatically be generated withÂ [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

A `"noindex"` tag will be automatically included on your Stoplight workspace domain in order to provide the best SEO indexing for your custom domain.

## Additional options

Once your domain has been configured, you can optionally enable analytics using Google Tag Manger and hide the `"Sign in"` button from the sidebar when your Workspace is loaded from your domain.

## Troubleshooting

### 1. **Cloudflare-hosted domains**

If you are usingÂ [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/), be sure to set your CNAME record to "DNS Only" (signified by a grey cloud, andÂ **not**Â an orange cloud).

You can read more about what this means in the CloudFlare documentationÂ [here](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200169626-What-subdomains-are-appropriate-for-orange-gray-clouds-).

### 2. **The connection has timed out**

If you see an error related to "The connection has timed out", this typically means that a CAA DNS record is present on your domain, which is preventing the TLS verification process from completing.

> ** ðŸ‘‰ Note:** To learn more about CAA records and what they are used for, see the Let's Encrypt documentationÂ [here](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/caa/). You can perform a CAA lookup on your domainÂ [here](https://dnslookup.online/caa.html)Â for reference.

To resolve this issue, use either option below:

- **RECOMMENDED**Â AddÂ `letsencrypt.org`Â to the CAA record to allow Let's Encrypt to generate certificates for your domain.
- **NOT RECOMMENDED**Â Remove the CAA DNS record from your domain, which will allow any authority to generate certificates for the domain.

Once updated, try to navigate to your custom domain again to verify the issue has been resolved.
