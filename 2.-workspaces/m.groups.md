# Groups

Groups allow you to organize projects in your sidebar and grant project access to users in bulk.

<!-- theme: warning -->

> This functionality is in **alpha** and subject to change.

## Group Visibility & Access

Group visibility defines what account type(s) can see or join a group.

**Public**
Anyone can see this group, but only workspace Members can join this group.

**Internal**
Only workspace Members can see and join this group. Workspace Guests cannot see this group unless they are added as a group member.

## Group Member Roles

Being part of a group automatically grants you read access to all projects in that group. _This currently includes Private projects._ Use this to quickly onboard new clients, engineers, and doc writers.

Additional roles give further control over the contents of the group.

<!-- theme: info -->

> A group memberâ€™s role does not currently apply to the projects within the group. For example, group Editors do not automatically have edit access on every project in the group.

## Project Organization

Joining groups and their projects populates your sidebar. Making groups and projects public adds the same helpful nested structure to your public docs too.
