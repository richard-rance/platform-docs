# **Invite Team Members**

The **Stoplight** Platform has been built with a modern API workflow in mind, providing your team with the tools to work on a single platform thought out the API Lifecycle. 

Once you have your **workspace** set up, the next step should be to invite your colleagues and partners to collaborate on API design, view documentation, and access mock servers.

You can invite up to 5 team members on the **Free** and **Starter** plan and more as you scale up. 

## Inviting Team Members to your workspace

1. From your dashboard, click on the **workspace name** on top left of the page. 
2. Next, select **Members** from the dropdown. This will take you to member settings.

Since you would be inviting different stakeholders from different parts of the API Lifecycle, you can limit and restrict, who gets access to what.
